				<h1>What Projects have I done?</h1>
				<p>I have completed a lot of projects in my life time, some for fun, some for commission. Here is a list of the more noteable ones.</p>

			<div class="col col-8">
				<h1>Renesas MCU Car Rally</h1>
				<p>The Renesas MCU Car Rally is an event held in Germany in which different Universities go head to head in order to make a small hand-built car navigate through a track by itself. The Group I worked with consists of 5 members, Daniel McCluskey, Thomas Hopkins, Zack Raeburn, Connor Liggins and Morgan James. During the course of the project, every team member contributed towards the completion of the car, including both the building of the car and the coding of the car. This project helped us since the learning experience opened up many opportunities for the future and expanded our knowledge of Software and Hardware integration.</p>

				<h1>Pacman</h1>
				<p>For one of my assignments at University, I had to re-create a 2D arcade game. The Game I chose was Pacman, I had to develop the game in Visual Studio using the C++ Programming language. The project all-in-all took about a week.</p>

				<h1>Reddit to Facebook Bot</h1>
				<p>As a small Python exercise, using the PRAW reddit API and the Facebook Graph API, I made a bot which takes posts from Reddit and posts them to a Facebook page which can be found below. Currently the bot has no use other than posting pictures from one particular subreddit, but could be used for much more. The source code can be found <a href="#">here</a></p>

				<h1>Shades</h1>
				<p>In 2015, I was given the task of recreating a Mobile App called Shades in a popular video game called Minecraft. Shades is a very fast paced game that requires you to think on your feet, very simple concept, surprisingly challenging. As of 2017, the recreation currently has over 16,000 Downloads and the trailer has over 27,000 views.</p>
